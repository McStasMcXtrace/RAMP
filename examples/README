-------------------- LET EXAMPLE

The LET example contains a mostly faithful reproduction of the primary spectrometer
of the LET instrument at ISIS. The monitor outputs show:

    1. The moderator spectrum (as a function of energy).
    2. The chopped spectrum (as a function of energy).
    3. A 2D histogram of x-divergence vs. x (phase space plot) at the sample position.
    4. A 2D histogram of theta vs. TOF in a banana detector, showing the scattering from
            a powder sample possessing a single Bragg peak.

The output of all of these monitors have been seen to be in perfect agreement with an
identical instrument being simulated in McStas.

-------------------- TAS EXAMPLE

The TAS example contains a simple triple-axis spectrometer consisting of a continuous
source, whose spectrum currently mimics the VCS source at the ILL, a PG monochromator,
a powder sample possessing a single Bragg peak, a PG analyser, and a point detector.

The python script that wraps the TAS example performs a rocking scan of the analyser angle,
and plots the resulting intensity as a function of angle to demonstrate the energy
resolution of the spectrometer around the elastic line.

The monitor outputs show:

    1. The source spectrum (as a function of energy).
    2. The monochromator output (as a function of energy).
    3. A planar position sensitive detector at the sample position.
    4. A twotheta/alpha position sensitive banana detector at the sample position.
    5. A planar position sensitive detector at the point detector position.

This example makes extensive use of the relative positioning/rotation functionality.

The output of this example has not yet been extensively verified.
